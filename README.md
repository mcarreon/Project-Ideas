# Project Ideas

I always come up with ideas but when it comes down to actually starting a new project I never know what to do. I'll be adding project ideas to this list so I won't have to worry about that again! Feel free to add to the list or use any of the ideas.

## Websites

- Meal Plan Generator
  - Generates a meal plan based off of the ingredients you have in the refridgerator or a premade recipe list. Possibly use an API to generate recipes? Can filter generation through added tags onto recipes or "types". Maybe even introduce a companion app that texts or notifies you of a grocery list every week.

- MTG Arena Deck Builder
  - Solo deck builder app, no tracking etc. Simple and allows you to few curve by card type, basic features.

## Misc

- Chrome New Tab Extension
  - Simple Markdown Notes Editor? Save notes to sidebar or download notes/upload to google docs or something like that.
